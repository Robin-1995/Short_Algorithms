# Short_Algorithms
A collection of short algorthims, this will updated as they are uploaded to GitHub

I've written some short algorithms in python, they include:

1) K_Closest_Points_to_Origin
   this function takes in 2 arguments, an array of coordinates (tuples) and k, where k is the number of coordinates to return (default = 1
   example: closest_points([(0,1),(2,2),(3,1),(1,1)],2) will return [(0,1),(1,1)]
